Hi, This PHP Class will create Blogs for you.
It is currently capable of these themes:
    - Default: (Copies my friend Generak's Blog layout, looks much worse
                and this is intentional as I dont want you to just steal
                his blog.)
    ... (EXPAND)

Usage:
    Require it : require('./objects/Blog.php');
    Construct A Object : $test = new Blog('d','Jonathan\'s Blog', 'Really Cool Stuff On This Blog.');
    The Parameters to the constructor are
        - "Theme: Referenced via full name or first letter. e.g. D or Default"
        - "Blog Title: What you wish to name the blog."
        - "Blog Description: What you wish the blog description to be."


CURRENT ISSUES:
    For each layout you will have to copy a .css file for the relevant theme to
    the same location for the .php file, I haven't really got any idea how to
    fix this yet and would love suggestions.
